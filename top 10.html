         <center> BOX JELLYFISH (wikimedia)</center>
         <P>
        There are number of species of box jellyfish,but they are all quite dangerous.<br>
        The sea was box jellyfish is prerhaps most deadly variety.This translucent<br>
        sea-dweller may not look all that manacing,but it  is the most venomous animal<br>
        on planet earth. Box jellyfish are deadly to many diffrent animals,not the least<br>
        of all us.If you get stung by one of these animals,you are very likely to die.<br>
        Even if you do not,you will be tremdous pain for some time of terward.
         </P>
 <br><br><br>
         <h2><U>2. CONE SNAIL</U></h2> 
          <img src="Cone-Snail.jpg" alt="CONE SNAIL" width="800px" height="400px">
         <center>CONE SNAIL (wikimedia)</center>
          <P>
      Another ocean dweller to be wary of is the cone snail.It may not look like much,<br>
      and you may easily mistake it for any other snail on the beach,but it is extremly<br>
      deadly.Just one drop of its venom can kill twenty human adults.There is no antivenin<br>
      which means that if you are stung,you will allmost certainly be dead with in minutes.
         </P>

         <center>BLACK MAMBA (wikimedia)</center>
         <P>
      This snake may look less fearsome than the hooded cobra,but it arguably more dangerous.<br>
      It can strike very qiukly and can also chase its victims at an increble speed.<br>
      It chooses to do quite often without any provocation.<br>
         </P>
         <br><br><br>
          <h2><U>4. CAPE BUFFALO</U></h2>
         <img src="Y:\my project of html\Cape-Buffalo.jpg" alt="CAPE BUFFALO" width="800px" height="400px">
          <center>CAPE BUFFALO (wikimedia)</center>
         <P>
      This is a particular aggressive inhabitant of the african grasslands.Cape buffalo<br>
      have been known to charge victims without provocation,rather like the black mamba.<br>
      While they are obviously not venomous,they do have an asset the mamba does not-2,000<br>
      pounds of weight and the ability to charge at 40 miles an hour.These creatures will <br>
      coninue charging even if they are shot in the heart,and have no reservations about <BR>
      charging vehicles.They've also been known to attack predators like lions.
         </P>
             <br><br><br>
              <h2><U>5. SIAFU ANTS</U></h2>
         <img src="Driver-Ants.jpg" alt="SIAFU ANTS" width="800px" height="400px">
             <center>SIAFU ANTS (wikimedia)</center>
         <P>
     These ants are also known as driver ants. They come in swarms of up to 50,000,000,and<br>
     will react as if they are a single entity if even one driver ant is in danger.Crush <br>
     one of these little critters underfoot while you are out on a walk and you will regret<br>
     it as the other 50 million come swarming after you.the ones that latch on will be very hard<br>
     to remove.Their jaws will remain clamped into your flesh even if you tear their bodies in half.<br>
     While they may not be the most deadly critters on this list,they are certainly impressively <br>
     dangerous for their size. They routinely take down and kill much larger things.Look up"ant attack"<br>
     and you will find many photos of this phenomenon.         
         </P>
             <br><br><br>
              <h2><U>6. DEATHSTALKER SCORPION </U></h2>
         <img src="Deathstalker-Scorpion.jpg" alt=" DEATHSTALKER SCORPION" width="800px" height="400px">
              <center>DEATHSTALKER SCORPION (wikimedia)</center>
         <P>
    This diminutive scorpion may not look all that impressive, but it is responsible for roughly three<br>
    fourths of all deaths resulting from scorpions every year.Children are particularly susceptible to these<br>
    bites and are moere likely to die from them than adults. The bite is very painful,so even survive,you may<br>   
    wish you had not for a while.         
         </P>
             <br><br><br>
                  <h2><U>7. PUFFER FISH </U></h2>
         <img src="Puffer-Fish.jpg" alt=" PUFFER FISH" width="800px" height="400px">
              <center>PUFFER FISH (wikimedia)</center>
         <P>
  This one of the most deadly animals inhabiting the ocean.They are deceptively cute,but quite dangerous<br>
  When threatened,they puff out their protruding spines.The venom from their spines can paralyze you,causing<br>
  you to step breathing,resulting in death.for that matter,if you eat improperly prepared puffer fish,you<br>
  can also die.              
         </P>
             <br><br><br>
               <h2><U>8. HYENA </U></h2>
         <img src="Hyena.jpg" alt=" HYENA" width="800px" height="400px">
              <center>HYENA (wikimedia)</center>
         <P>
    The hyena is genrally a scavenger,but it can also hunt prey if it wants to.During times of high human<br>
    death toll(war,for example),it can develop a taste for human flesh. if corpses are not plentiful enough,<br>
    it has been known to take to hunting,and will deliberately pursue human quarry to satisfy its hunger.         
         </P>
             <br><br><br>
              <h2><U>9. STONE FISH </U></h2>
              <img src="Stonefish.jpg" alt="STONE FISH" width="800px" height="400px"> 
              <center>STONE FISH (wikimedia)</center>
         <P>
         These fish are dangrous not only  because they are the most venomous fish on the planet,but also <br>
         because they are incredibly fast and also very hard to see.They are camouflaged naturally to blend<br>
         in with the ocean floor. While hey are only aggressive toward their prey,it is easy to make the mistake<br>
         of stepping on one.The venom from the spines can cost you a limb or even kill you.     
         </P>
             <br><br><br>
              <h2><U>10. HUMANS </U></h2>
         <img src="Humans.jpg" alt="HUMANS" width="800px" height="400px">
              <center>HUMANS (wikimedia)</center>
         <P>
        Human being may not stand to win in a fair fight against most of these species,but thanks to our<br>
        ingenuity,we have learned how to arm ourselves with weapons and tools which have placed us at <br>
        the top of the food chain(at least for the time being). We also get extra points on the deadly scale<br>
        for our aggression,not only toward other animals,but toward each other.The scale to which we take our <br>
        destruction in unique.No other animal starts worldwide wars or blasts whole regions of the earth into<br>
        total ruin with nuclear weapons.Without a doubt,the most dangerous animals in the world is the face you<br>
        see in the mirror each day.     
         </P>
