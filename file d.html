Established in 1980, The Wild Animal Sanctuary (TWAS), is a state and federally licensed zoological facility and a 501(c)(3) nonprofit<br> 
organization.Originally started outside Boulder, CO, TWAS soon moved to Lyons, CO, where there was more room for the animals, and to provide<br>
for future expansion. After eight years at that location, TWAS was forced to move again due to a limestone quarry beginning rock blasting <br>
operations on adjacent land.The Sanctuary was relocated to Keenesburg, CO in 1994 and continued its operations on an initial 160 acres located <br>
just 30 miles north of Denver (50 miles east of Boulder). The new site offered plenty of space for large acreage habitats to be built, as well <br>
as additional grassland buffers that could be used as pasture for rescued horses, camels, yaks and other various hoof stock.The Sanctuary was <br>
not open to the public at that time, but did allow supporters and their guests who wanted to learn about the Captive Wildlife Crisis to visit on<br>
special occasions.By 2001 the Sanctuary knew the overall need for educating the public had begun to outweigh its desire to remain closed to public<br>
visitation.As such,Sanctuary management and Board of Directors agreed to build an initial elevated walkway and observation deck so that interested <br>
people and the general public could begin visiting on a regular basis.Since 2001, the Sanctuary has been open daily from 9:00 AM to Sunset, except <br>
for major holidays and during bad weather.The Sanctuary remains located on rural, rolling grasslands northeast of the Denver Metro area. Currently,<br>
this facility occupies 1,214 acres and shelters more than 550 Lions, Tigers, Bears, Leopards, Mountain Lions, Wolves and other large carnivores.<br>
It still remains the first sanctuary of its kind to create large acreage species-specific habitats for rescued animals.Since January, 1980, The <br>
Wild Animal Sanctuary has responded to more than 1,000 requests from private citizens and government agencies to rescue animals from across the <br>
United States and around the world. Our furry residents were abused, abandoned, illegally kept, or were victims of other terrible situations.By <br>
2017, nearly all the surrounding land that had previously been available for purchase at the Keenesburg site was gone.The Sanctuary had been <br>
fortunate to grow from 160 acres in 1994 to more than 789 in 2017.Yet,the time had come where future growth was no longer possible in Keenesburg.<br>
In order to continue its mission of rescuing animals and providing life-long care, additional land at a different location would need to be procured.<br>
Fortunately,the Sanctuary was able to find a 9,752-acre parcel of land located in southern Colorado near the town of Springfield.A second site was proposed<br> 
and a fundraising campaign was put into place to purchase the 9,000-plus acre property.In 2018, the Sanctuary closed on the property and began building what<br>
is now known as The Wild Animal Refuge.With such a massive amount of land, the possibilities were endless when it came to creating large acreage natural <br>
habitats for the animals.  Ranging from 5 acres to over 300 acres in size, The Wild Animal Refuge represents the future home for animals that will be <br>
rescued going forward.The Sanctuary in Keenesburg continues to be home for hundreds of rescued animals, and will continue to educate hundreds of thousands<br>
of people per year about the Captive Wildlife Crisis.  However, the majority of animals that will be rescued going forward will, for the most part, go to the<br>
Refuge where they can live in amazingly natural habitats.Older animals that are too weak, or are in need of special medical attention, still come to the Sanctuary<br>
where they can be closely monitored.  Younger, and more healthy animals currently go directly to the Refuge.In 2018, TWAS took over the 41-acre facility located in<br>
Boyd, Texas known as The Wild Animal Sanctuary Texas (TWAS-Texas). This 41-acre Sanctuary is home to 70+ Lions, Tigers, Bears,Wolves, and other rescued captive <br>
wildlife.The Sanctuary's newest addition acquired in early 2023 includes our 22,450-thousand-acre facility in Craig, CO known as The Wild Horse Refuge! The Wild <br>
 Horse Refuge was created entirely for rescued Wild Mustangs that were victims of the BLM. The Wild Mustangs get to again, and for the rest of their lives run, <br>
buck, and explore freely with no worries! Today, The Wild Animal Sanctuary encompasses more than 33,000 acres of space, with over 120 habitats. At TWAS, the <br>
animals come first! Providing expert care and rehabilitation, exceptional diets and enrichment, and large spaces in which to roam make life for our rescued <br>
animals the kind of life they would have if they could <br>choose it.Education about the Captive Wildlife Crisis and its causes and solutions are critical to <br>
changing social consciousness today, in order to provide a better future for captive wildlife. TWAS welcomes supporters, school groups and organizations to our <br>
Education Center at the Sanctuary, and also has a Speakers Bureau whose members do presentations for a variety of businesses, universities and other organizations.<br>
A shocking statistic about America’s Captive Wildlife Crisis; the illicit exotic animal trade is the third largest source of illegal profits in the world today, just<br>
after illegal drugs and weapons! In the U.S. alone, there are an estimated 30,000 captive large carnivores living outside the zoo system. There are 4,000 Tigers living<br>
as “pets” in private homes in just the state of Texas – which is more Tigers than exist in the wild throughout the world. Countless other Great Cats, Bears,Wolves <br>
and other large carnivores live in abusive conditions in roadside zoos, circuses, magic acts, traveling shows, and other substandard situations. Untold numbers of <br>
animals suffer and die each year due to neglect, abuse or because they are abandoned and left to die, starving and alone.Public safety is also a serious issue. Every<br>
year, people get hurt or killed by captive wild animals that have not been properly housed, or because the people were allowed to be in unsafe situations by the<br>
animals’ owners or keepers. TWAS is called upon by local, state and national law enforcement agencies to ensure public safety in situations where the public and<br>
/or animals are at risk.The three main points of our mission…(1) to rescue captive large carnivores who have been abused, abandoned, illegally kept or exploited<br>
…(2) to create for them a wonderful life for as long as they live…and (3) to educate about the causes and solutions to the Captive Wildlife Crisis… are what we <br>
commit to for the animals, and for the humans who help to make a positive difference for them.</p></center><br><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>
